# Erk Engine

**Erk** is a desktop browser engine written in Rust.

- Built on mature Rust components: html5ever, Stylo, Taffy, Parley, Vello
- Original work where none of them reach: inline layout, the process model and
  sandbox, networking and security policy, and the browser shell
- Progress measured with the [Web Platform Tests](https://web-platform-tests.org/),
  not calendar dates

> Erk is at the very beginning. It cannot browse the web yet.

## Status

The current milestone is **M0 — first pixel**: open a local HTML file in a
single process and paint it in a window or to a PNG. Multi-process isolation
and sandboxing come in M3, JavaScript in M4. See the
[roadmap](docs/plans/roadmap.md) (Turkish) for every milestone and its
acceptance criterion.

## Building

Requirements:

- A recent stable [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/); the exact version is
  pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`
- On Windows: the MSVC Build Tools with the C++ workload
- Python 3 (used by Stylo's build script)

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

Run instructions will be added when M0 is complete.
